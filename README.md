A project that uses AI for generating a song based on inputted tunes. Written in JS and Rust.

To serve the project set up a local http-server in the front-end folder. You also need to compile the wasm in the integrated_rust folder (`run wasm-pack build --target web`). If you don't have wasm-pack you also need to install it: `cargo install wasm-pack`
