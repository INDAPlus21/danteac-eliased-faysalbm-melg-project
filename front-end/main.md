// this is so goddamn confusing reading a letter and pressing a different letter, implement synethesia-like  
// should you have one octave even lower ? 
/* Quote: From what I can find out online, most modern MIDI equipment (keyboards, controllers) sends Note On messages with a velocity of 0 to end a note, rather than Note Off messages as per the spec. IIUC this is to make it easier to send a complete sequence of notes using running status. Makes sense.
// have accompaniment!!! (play left hand, while program is playing right) 
// the tiles are moving a little????  
// what wait?? using the mouse for playing notes doesn't delay the whole thing? or is it me typing that does it? the http server must update in soe way 
// aha! it requests all the files from the http server OVER AND OVER again (and that brings tons of slowdown). the solution would be to iterate over the should_play track and download all the mp3 files that you're going to be using (even dynamically!)
// the problem with the animation approach is that all the divs have the same id (!) 1
// ok... it starteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed to flicker a little      bit... prbably shouldn't drecrease it

// okay... looking at the js library THEY  
// actually use a similar approach to me already. 
// and I can actually do stuff like setting the audio.volume... 
// they stop the channel by... THERE IS AN audio.pause() (of course there is!)  
// wtf
// I definitely don't need an external library, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
// TO BUILD YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND MIDI BETTER, in order to create A BETTER MIDI
// PARSER, IN ORDER TO BUILD A BETTER AI (this project is way too ambitious)
// what is this??? it's totally random when it starts requesting all the files and when it doesn't?!?!??!?
